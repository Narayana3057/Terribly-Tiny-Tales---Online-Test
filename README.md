In this module I have used HTML,,CSS,JAVASCRIPT for frontend and java(Java servlet) for backend.

FRONTEND:
  languages: HTML , CSS ,JAVASCRIPT 
  it contains heading, text box, and submit button.
  
  i restricted the user to enter only numbres  by javascript function.
  
  when user click the submit button,it moves to backend for extracting required data.
  
 BACKEND:
  languages:JAVA
    Algorithm:
    1.store the text file data in scanner class object.
    2.now store word by word from scanner obj in string s. and append space after each word insertion
    3.split string to string array.so that each string store in specific index
    4.calculate frequency by using map(key,value)
    5.sort the map according to frequency
